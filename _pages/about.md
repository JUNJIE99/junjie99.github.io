Hi, I am Junjie Zhou, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn), advised by [Yongping Xiong](https://dblp.org/pid/61/8573.html). My research interests center on ***Multimodal Information Retrieval*** and ***Multimodal Large Language Models***. Currently, I am also a research intern at BAAI, mentored by [Zheng Liu](https://zhengliu101.github.io/). I expect to graduate in June 2026.
